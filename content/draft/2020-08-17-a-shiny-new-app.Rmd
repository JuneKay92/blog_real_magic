# First Things First: Installation

- "getting out the ingredients"
- important little details (like systme paths and starting your own application)
- one file or two?

# Pieces of the Pie

- UI
    - where you set up how the app looks
    - where you set the items for the app to keep track of
- server
    - where all the behind the scenes computations go
    - the reactivity portion of the app
- Global files
    - things that are static that the app just needs to be aware of

# How to get your app out there

- publishing
- where to host your apps
- follow up later about including them into your blogdown web pages
