```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

# What does CSS do?

- beautifying your documents
- personalize
- layout
- inserting backgrounds and images

# For the Website

- someone already made the majority of the CSS I used
- I just adjusted as needed
- Gave me a place to start and code to mess with to learn how it works

# In Some Slides

- using xarigan slides from the same guy who made blogdown
- again using premade themes as the base
- created my own theme, able to insert my own backgrounds and images
- even GIFs!
