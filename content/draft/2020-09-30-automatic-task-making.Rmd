## `taskscheduleR` package

- what is it?
- only works on windows!  other options for mac and linux but I mostly work on windows so I don't know how

## How does it work?

- create a script to be run through Rscript
- what is rscript?
- how often to scedule?
- output is in same file as scripts (another reason for projects!)

## Example

```{r, eval = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
### Need two files.  One for the code to run and one for setting up and running the tasks
# my_scheduler
the_time <- Sys.time()
print(the_time)
# task_setup
taskscheduler_create(taskname = "myfancyscript2", rscript = "C:/Users/hopesnyder/Desktop/scheduling/my_scheduler.R", 
                     schedule = "ONCE")
# task_run
taskscheduler_runnow(taskname = "testing")
```
