I am a burgeoning data scientist, beginning work on my doctoral disseration in Quantitative Psychology at the University of Missouri. My career interests involve learning and sharing the world of data science.   I have experience with machine learning and feature engineering, Bayesian statistics, GIT version control, and app development with Shiny.  My analysis tool of choice is R, but I am learning Python as well. Outside of the professional world, I am an avid writer and I go rock climbing whenever I can.
