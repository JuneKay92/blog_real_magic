Code-RLadies is a group in mid-Missouri that is focused on promoting data science and related tools among under-represented groups. It is a chapter of R-Ladies Global for the mid-Missouri area.  I founded this group along with Linda Landon ([@researchcommunK](https://twitter.com/researchcommunK)) and Krista Gaylen ([@kgalyen](https://twitter.com/kgalyen)).  Our goal for the group is to create and grow a community for promoting and supporting each other in the data science world.  While the main focus of the group is around the programming language R, we also want to be inclusive in programming languages.  By learning a large variety of programming techniques and skills we can become stronger in our chosen area of expertise. 

No matter your gender identity or level of expertise, we would love to have you join us! Check us out [here](https://code-rladies.github.io/)!
