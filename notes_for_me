Info about how the website is set up

1) content holds all the content and pages for the website.  A little exploring of each of the files that are there all ready has revealed the following:
  - _index.md is the title page big picture area.
  - about.md is for the about page (obviously)
  - the sections folder has the extra stuff at the bottom of the home page.  I could kinda make a self summary/pitch here I guess.
  - contact is the contact page, but it doesn't have anything for including the form widget so... how do I get rid of that? here's hoping it works with netlify... I don't think so though...

2) there are two folders for new posts: "post" and "posts" Blogdown naturally creates new posts in the "post" folder.  But for this theme, it wants things in the "posts" folder.  So I can write up a post entirely and hold it until I'm ready to make it public.

3) with that the way to add a page to the site I need to add a bit to the config file like this:

[[menu.main]]
    name = "Testing"
    url = "/test"

It will show up at the end of the menu list.  OR in the markdown document.  Steal the one from the about page and change the title and the weight values.  Seems a little better and I can have a bit more control.

4) Change the colors for the background things in base.css and in style.css.  The website will need to be reinitialized so restart R and serve the site again to see the updates.

5)How to set up things to update automatically once hosted on netlify:
  - (potentially) put public folder under .gitignore once the full set up is up and ready.
  - connect Netlify to my Github to get it to render automatically.
  - don't need to prebuild to publish on netlify
  
6) from example webistes that I hunted down:
  - [[menu.links]] Adds links to the menu bar to other websites and things.  Maybe I can stick my full resume there?
  - 
  
7) Theme fucking hates RMD files.  SO this is bullshit.  Everything I have done for weeks is all fucking worthless.  Can't even save it as a fucking stupid md file because all the pictures are broken, the code chunks look awful, the layout is stupid....  God why did I even try.

  - I did find where to fix the margins problem in style.css at least...  It's something with the css and the headers. It indents them and I can't figure out why.  There is nothing in the code the I can see for right now.  I'm so close, I can feel it. I FOUND IT BITCHES!!! under style.css the section area!  Under the post_body part is the max width for the whole post!!!
  
  - I can make it work... I guess I can deal with the output of the code.  I just can't have any output and code done in the same chunk.  It'll have to be split so I can format it a little better.  And the HTML tags are doable.  I want to learn how to read that code anyway.  The figures can still be put into the posts and referenced in the text.  A unique look, right?

8) Found where to change the summary on the "card" for the blog posts.  In theme/layout/_default/card.html  Not really the main problem right now but at least I can maybe change the summary of the blog post somehow.

9) tags can't have spaces

10) images it seems can be put in two different ways:
  - ![](/image/hocus_pocus.jpg) (a way to put in captions for the picture but no control over sizes)
  - <img src="/image/hocus_pocus.jpg" width=300 /> (a way to adjust sizes and prolly a lot of other options.  I'll need to look up how to do it in HTML)
  
11) signed up for the formspree thing, but i don't think I can test it with it being locally served.  We'll see what happens when I actually deploy the blog.  OR see about it being done by Netlify once it's hosted.

12) I added something to the custom.css file to center my images when I add them to posts. It will end up looking like this: <img src="/image/hocus_pocus.jpg" width=500 class="center"/>
